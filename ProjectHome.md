The php based Equipment Checkout is designed to meet the needs of a university equipment checkout. It has the ability to group students and equipment by class and limit avilablility by those groupings. It can also group major pieces of equipment with accessories for kits so that smaller items (batteries, lens caps, etc.) are tracked as well.

Laptop Attendance uses an Apple iSight Camera and a USB card swipe to record the image, time, and student ID. Students are grouped by class making it easy to report attendance for lectures, concerts, or events that were previosuly tracked by having students get a program stamped at the event.
